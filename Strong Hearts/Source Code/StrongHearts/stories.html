                  <p>In my case, it started as verbal abuse. I’d known my partner for 20 years and he was a good person.
                      He started changing in 2015. After his mum died, he bought several guns including a machete and a shotgun.
                     One evening in early November it turned physical. We’d broken up, but we were starting to work things out again, when one morning we had a disagreement. 
                     I was in the bathtub, when he came in and shot me. I can only remember the last two gunshots.
                      I look up at him and he says “‘Look what you made me do Sanudhi”, ‘You made me shoot you.’
                      He returned with my cell phone and I told him to dial 911. I felt as though I was dying. My legs felt prickly.
                      I didn’t realize he’d shot me in the back and I was already paralyzed.
                     I can remember being loaded into the paramedics truck and saying to the female paramedic, “please don’t let me die, I have four children to raise.” I spent 3 weeks in hospital. 
                     During that time around 400 people came to visit me. That’s when I realized I had a message I wanted to share.
                     Since then, I’ve been doing a lot of public speaking – not just about gun violence and domestic violence, 
                     but about gun control and mental health. If people are willing to listen, I want to talk about the things that matter.

                  <p>I met my abuser when I was 14. At first there wasn’t physical abuse, it was emotional. He would embarrass me or make feel inferior in front of other people. 
                     It went from verbal to physical real fast. When I was seven months pregnant, he beat me until I was on the floor, curled in a ball.
                     While I was in the hospital having my child, he cashed my mom’s cheque and bought drugs to sell. We were behind on rent, 
                     and the landlord took everything I owned out of the home and put it on the curb.Finally, I made up my mind: I wasn’t going back. 
                     He managed to track me down. He showed up at my doorway, 
                     and just like that, it was on again. Mentally I was broken. He made me believe he was the only person who would ever love me.
                     When I was seven months pregnant with my sixth child, he pulled a gun on me. I saw a big flash of light and my jaw swayed. I saw my shirt. It was red. 
                     The doctors told me that the only reason that the shot didn’t kill me was because he had the wrong calibre bullet in the gun.I’ve had six surgeries, and I am still living with the physical effects of the shooting as well as the trauma.
                      I’ve been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite everything that’s happened I am determined to raise awareness about domestic violence.
                       I posted a video on Facebook – I was crying but I wanted to tell people what I’d been through.
                       It’s important for women in that situation to hear from someone who understands. A lot of people might say, “You’re so stupid, you should have stayed gone.” 
                       They don’t understand the hold an abuser has on his victim.

                  <p>We were married at 18, had three children and stayed together for nearly 15 years. I didn’t realize what I was in an abusive marriage.

                     After we divorced, he always knew where I was. Once my co-worker texted me and said, 
                     ‘He is down the street just sitting in his company vehicle’. The police escorted me back to my office.
                     I took out a protective order against my ex. A couple of weeks later, he left the severed leg of a pig in our boys’ diaper bag with a note saying that the boys wanted it as a souvenir.
                      He had gone hunting and cut off the leg. There was blood all over it. Even with the protective order in place, he stalked and harassed me. I was still too scared to call the police. 
                      He barged into my house and threatened to kill himself, to kill other people. My ex had been acting aggressively towards my kids for years, and judging from the escalating violence with other women, I knew that my children needed protection.
                      I met with the staff attorney at Faith House and we filed for sole custody. It was traumatic going through it all again, 
                      but the judge ruled in my favor and now I have sole custody of my kids, and a permanent protective order for us all.
